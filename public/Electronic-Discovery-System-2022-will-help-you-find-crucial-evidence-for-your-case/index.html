        <p>In 2002, the US Congress passed the Electronic Discovery Act, which mandated that electronic evidence be preserved in anticipation of litigation. The law recognized the fact that more and more business was being conducted electronically, and that a growing number of lawsuits were being filed that relied on digital evidence.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2022. The Electronic Discovery System (EDS) is a cutting-edge software application that can help attorneys locate crucial evidence for their cases. It scans through email messages, attachments, text documents, and other files, quickly identifying relevant content.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of using EDS is that it can search through both the original files and the backup copies. This is important because many times electronic files are deleted or changed after they are initially created. EDS can find these deleted or altered files, helping you to build a stronger case.</p>
<p>Another benefit of EDS is its ability to export data into a variety of formats. This allows you to easily share information with co-counsel or expert witnesses. You can also use it to create reports and charts that will help you make your case in court.</p>
