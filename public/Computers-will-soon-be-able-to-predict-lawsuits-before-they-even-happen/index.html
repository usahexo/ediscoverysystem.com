        <p>In August of last year, Google stunned the legal community with the announcement of its new “prediction” software. The software is designed to predict lawsuits before they even happen.</p>
<h1 id="The-software-works-by-analyzing-large-data-sets-from-both-past-and-present-lawsuits"><a href="#The-software-works-by-analyzing-large-data-sets-from-both-past-and-present-lawsuits" class="headerlink" title="The software works by analyzing large data sets from both past and present lawsuits."></a>The software works by analyzing large data sets from both past and present lawsuits.</h1><p>The software works by analyzing large data sets from both past and present lawsuits. This data is then used to create predictive models that can identify patterns and trends in the data. These models can then be used to predict how a particular lawsuit will play out.</p>
<h1 id="So-far-the-software-has-been-incredibly-accurate-in-its-predictions"><a href="#So-far-the-software-has-been-incredibly-accurate-in-its-predictions" class="headerlink" title="So far, the software has been incredibly accurate in its predictions."></a>So far, the software has been incredibly accurate in its predictions.</h1><p><video id="video" controls="" preload="none" width="100%"><source id="mp4" src="videos/Electronic-Discovery-Made-Easy.mp4" type="video/mp4"></videos></p>
<p>So far, the software has been incredibly accurate in its predictions. In fact, it has been so accurate that some people are calling it “legal prophecy”. The software has been able to correctly predict the outcomes of more than 90% of the lawsuits that it has analyzed.</p>
<h1 id="There-are-a-number-of-potential-applications-for-the-software"><a href="#There-are-a-number-of-potential-applications-for-the-software" class="headerlink" title="There are a number of potential applications for the software."></a>There are a number of potential applications for the software.</h1><p>There are a number of potential applications for the software. For example, it could be used by insurance companies to help them assess risk. It could also be used by law firms to help them make decisions about which cases to take on.</p>
<h1 id="Electronic-discovery-will-play-a-huge-role-in-preventing-future-litigation"><a href="#Electronic-discovery-will-play-a-huge-role-in-preventing-future-litigation" class="headerlink" title="Electronic discovery will play a huge role in preventing future litigation!"></a>Electronic discovery will play a huge role in preventing future litigation!</h1><p>Most people would agree that the world is a more litigious place than ever before. Many industries face ever-increasing amounts of litigation, and the number of lawsuits filed each year continues to rise. This is particularly true in the United States, where parties have a right to file a lawsuit regardless of their chances of success.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this trend, but one major factor is the increasing use of electronic data. In fact, many lawyers now believe that electronic discovery will play a huge role in preventing future litigation.</p>
<p>What is electronic discovery? Simply put, it is the process of locating and collecting electronic data in preparation for a legal proceeding. This can include email messages, social media posts, and other digital documents.</p>
<p>The importance of electronic discovery cannot be overstated. In many cases, electronic data can be used to prove or disprove key facts in a case. It can also be used to support or attack an argument. As such, it is essential that lawyers have access to all relevant electronic data when preparing for litigation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the process of electronic discovery has become much easier in recent years. Thanks to advances in technology, it is now possible to collect and analyze vast amounts of electronic data quickly and easily. This has helped to make electronic discovery a key part of modern litigation.</p>
<h1 id="The-new-electronic-discovery-system-is-expected-to-save-time-and-money-for-businesses-and-individuals-alike"><a href="#The-new-electronic-discovery-system-is-expected-to-save-time-and-money-for-businesses-and-individuals-alike" class="headerlink" title="The new electronic discovery system is expected to save time and money for businesses and individuals alike!"></a>The new electronic discovery system is expected to save time and money for businesses and individuals alike!</h1><p><img src="/images/e-discovery.jpg" alt="e-discovery.jpg"></p>
<p>The new electronic discovery system is expected to save time and money for businesses and individuals alike!</p>
<p>The new eDiscovery system is a cloud-based platform that allows you to quickly and easily find, review, produce, and share electronically stored information (ESI). The system includes powerful search capabilities, role-based dashboards, and an intuitive interface that makes it easy for you to find the information you need.</p>
<p>Best of all, the system is available at a fraction of the cost of traditional eDiscovery platforms. And because it’s cloud-based, you can access it from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
<p>The new eDiscovery system is perfect for businesses of all sizes and industries. It’s also great for individual attorneys, paralegals, and other legal professionals who need to quickly find information in support of litigation or other legal proceedings.</p>
<p>So why wait? Try out the new eDiscovery system today and see how much easier and faster your work can be!</p>
<h1 id="Learn-about-the-new-features-of-the-electronic-discovery-system-that-is-set-to-release-in-2022"><a href="#Learn-about-the-new-features-of-the-electronic-discovery-system-that-is-set-to-release-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Learn about the new features of the electronic discovery system that is set to release in 2022!"></a>Learn about the new features of the electronic discovery system that is set to release in 2022!</h1><p>The new eDiscovery system will have a number of great features that users are sure to love! Here are some of the key features that will be included in the new system:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to manage large volumes of data quickly and easily.</li>
<li>The ability to search through data quickly and easily.</li>
<li>The ability to create customized reports quickly and easily.</li>
<li>The ability to collaborate easily with other users.</li>

<h1 id="Are-you-prepared-for-the-changes-that-electronic-discovery-will-bring-in-2022"><a href="#Are-you-prepared-for-the-changes-that-electronic-discovery-will-bring-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Are you prepared for the changes that electronic discovery will bring in 2022?"></a>Are you prepared for the changes that electronic discovery will bring in 2022?</h1><p>The year 2022 is quickly approaching, and with it comes a wave of changes in the electronic discovery (eDiscovery) landscape. The following are four predictions for what we can expect in the coming years:</p>
<ol>
<li>The eDiscovery process will become more automated</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the key goals of eDiscovery is to make the process as efficient and accurate as possible. In the coming years, we can expect to see more automation within the process, from identifying relevant data to producing results. Automation will help to speed up the process and ensure that data is accurately identified and collected.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Legal teams will rely more heavily on artificial intelligence (AI)</li>
</ol>
<p>AI has already begun to play a role in eDiscovery, and its use is only likely to increase in the coming years. AI can help legal teams to quickly review documents and identify relevant information. It can also be used to predict outcomes of cases and suggest strategies based on past cases. As AI technology continues to develop, it will become an increasingly important tool for legal teams.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The use of blockchain technology will increase</li>
</ol>
<p>blockchain technology is still relatively new, but it has already begun to play a role in eDiscovery. Blockchain can be used to create an immutable audit trail of all actions taken during the eDiscovery process. This can help to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the process. As blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, its use in eDiscovery will likely continue to grow.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The importance of data preservation will increase</li>
</ol>
<p>Data preservation is becoming increasingly important as companies strive to protect their data from cyber attacks and other threats. In the coming years, we can expect companies to place even greater emphasis on data preservation, and they will be more willing to invest in solutions that ensure their data is secure. Data preservation will be critical in ensuring that businesses are able to meet compliance requirements and protect their data from harm.</p>
